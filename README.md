# FOUNDIR

FOUNDIR is a facial recognition application designed to identify and flag instances of exploitation of individuals' names and likenesses on explicit sites. Originally named FOUNDR, the project's master file was amended to FOUNDIR due to naming conflicts.

## Project Overview

FOUNDIR leverages advanced facial recognition technology to detect and monitor instances where individuals' identities are misused on explicit websites. By identifying and flagging such occurrences, FOUNDIR aims to significantly disrupt illicit activities and protect the privacy and dignity of its users.

## Ethical Considerations

FOUNDIR is not just a technological tool but a project with profound ethical implications. By dismantling a significant part of the criminal underworld involved in exploiting individuals, FOUNDIR seeks to empower and protect vulnerable populations, including women, individuals of any gender identity, non-binary individuals, children, and teens. Ethical developers are crucial to ensure that this technology is implemented responsibly and with sensitivity to privacy and human rights concerns.

## How FOUNDIR Works

FOUNDIR operates by:

- **Facial Recognition:** Utilizing AI-driven facial recognition algorithms to scan explicit sites.
- **Identification:** Matching uploaded images against databases to detect unauthorized use.
- **Flagging:** Notifying users or authorities of potential misuse of their likeness.
